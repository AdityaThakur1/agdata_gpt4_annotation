{"CommonName": "the satyr comma", "Order": "Lepidoptera", "Family": "Nymphalidae", "TextDesc": ["polygonia satyrus, also known as the satyr anglewing or satyr comma, is a butterfly species belonging to the family nymphalidae. here are some morphological identifying features of polygonia satyrus:", "1. wingspan: the wingspan of polygonia satyrus ranges from 4.5 to 6.4 cm (1.75 to 2.5 inches).", "2. wing shape: the wings of polygonia satyrus have a unique and characteristic angular shape with jagged edges, which gives them their common name \"anglewing.\"", "3. coloration: the upper side of the wings is orange-brown with dark brown to black markings, including a dark border around the edges and a series of small black spots near the wingtips. the underside of the wings is mottled gray-brown, resembling a dead leaf.", "4. silver markings: on the underside of the hindwing, there is a small silver comma-shaped marking, which gives the species its other common name \"comma.\" this marking helps to distinguish it from other similar-looking species.", "5. eye spots: polygonia satyrus has one or two small eyespots near the outer margin of the hindwing. these eyespots are black with a pale blue or white center.", "6. antennae: the antennae of polygonia satyrus are relatively short and have a clubbed tip.", "7. sexual dimorphism: males and females of polygonia satyrus are similar in appearance, but females tend to be slightly larger and have a more rounded forewing tip.", "8. larval stage: the caterpillar of polygonia satyrus is green with yellow markings and has a series of branching spines along its back. the head is also adorned with two long, curved spines.", "by observing these morphological features, one can identify polygonia satyrus among other butterfly species."]}
